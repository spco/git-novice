title: Collaborating
teaching: 25
exercises: 0
questions:
- "How can I use version control to collaborate with other people?"
objectives:
- "Clone a remote repository."
- "Collaborate pushing to a common repository."
keypoints:
- "`git clone` copies a remote repository to create a local repository with a remote called `origin` automatically set up."

For the next step, get into pairs.  One person will be the "Owner" and the other
will be the "Collaborator". The goal is that the Collaborator add changes into
the Owner's repository. We will switch roles at the end, so both persons will
play Owner and Collaborator.

The Owner needs to give the Collaborator access.
On Bitbucket, click the settings button on the right,
then select Collaborators, and enter your partner's username.

![Adding Collaborators on Bitbucket](../fig/bitbucket-add-collaborators.png)

To accept access to the Owner's repo, the Collaborator
needs to go to [https://github.com/notifications](https://github.com/notifications).
Once there she can accept access to the Owner's repo.

Next, the Collaborator needs to download a copy of the Owner's repository to her
 machine. This is called "cloning a repo". To clone the Owner's repo into
her `git-novice` folder, the Collaborator enters:

~~~
$ git clone https://vlad@bitbucket.org/vlad/planets.git ~/git-novice/vlad-planets
~~~
{: .bash}

Replace 'vlad' with the Owner's username.

![After Creating Clone of Repository](../fig/github-collaboration.svg)

The Collaborator can now make a change in her clone of the Owner's repository,
exactly the same way as we've been doing before:

~~~
$ cd ~/git-novice/vlad-planets
$ nano pluto.txt
$ cat pluto.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
It is so a planet!
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
$ git add pluto.txt
$ git commit -m "Add notes about Pluto"
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 pluto.txt
~~~
{: .output}

Then push the change to the *Owner's repository* on Bitbucket:

~~~
$ git push origin master
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
Counting objects: 4, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 306 bytes, done.
Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://vlad@bitbucket.org/vlad/planets.git
   9272da5..29aba7c  master -> master
~~~
{: .output}

Note that we didn't have to create a remote called `origin`: Git uses this
name by default when we clone a repository.  (This is why `origin` was a
sensible choice earlier when we were setting up remotes by hand.)

Take a look to the Owner's repository on its Bitbucket website now (maybe you need
to refresh your browser.) You should be able to see the new commit made by the
Collaborator.

To download the Collaborator's changes from Bitbucket, the Owner now enters:

~~~
$ git pull origin master
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
remote: Counting objects: 4, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 3 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.

Now the three repositories (Owner's local, Collaborator's local, and Owner's on
Bitbucket) are back in sync.

> ## A Basic Collaborative Workflow
>
> In practice, it is good to be sure that you have an updated version of the
> repository you are collaborating on, so you should `git pull` before making
> our changes. The basic collaborative workflow would be:
>
> * update your local repo with `git pull origin master`,
> * make your changes and stage them with `git add`,
> * commit your changes with `git commit -m`, and
> * upload the changes to Bitbucket with `git push origin master`
>
> It is better to make many commits with smaller changes rather than
> of one commit with massive changes: small commits are easier to
> read and review.

> ## Comment Changes in Bitbucket
>
> The Collaborator has some questions about one line change made by the Owner and
> has some suggestions to propose.
>
> With Bitbucket, it is possible to comment the diff of a commit. To the left the line of
> code to comment, a blue comment icon (a plus within a speech bubble) appears to open a comment window.
>
> The Collaborator posts its comments and suggestions using Bitbucket interface.
